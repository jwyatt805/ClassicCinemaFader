Q-SYS Plugin: Classic Cinema Fader

Plugin(qplug) that accepts up to 128ch audio channels and performs the Dolby 0-10 conversion. Behaves just like any common Gain component but with the extra sauce. The advantage to this approach is you don't need a control script/plugin that controls another gain component. The audio signal will pass through this and the functionality is embedded.
